Combinatorial problems may require techniques such as the principle of inclusion-exclusion, generating functions, stars and bars, or a case-by-case analysis. All variables introduced must be clearly defined, and the rationale for the chosen methods must be justified.  Complex problems should be decomposed into smaller, more tractable subproblems when necessary.  If the problem is of the multiple-choice variety, demonstrate the elimination of incorrect options through calculation.\n\n[Insert mathematical problem here]\n\n\n**Variation 3 (Focus on clarity):**\n\n> Carefully solve the following mathematical problem.  Your solution must be clear, complete, and easy to follow.  Each step should be explained thoroughly, and your final answer must be written as \\boxed{}. If you are unable to solve the problem, clearly state that you cannot find a solution.  For problems in combinatorics, you may find it helpful to use techniques such as the inclusion-exclusion principle, generating functions, stars and bars, or casework.  Be sure to define any variables you use and explain why you chose your particular solution method.  If the problem seems overwhelming, break it down into smaller parts.  If the problem has multiple choices, show your work in eliminating the incorrect answers.\n\n[Insert mathematical problem here]\n\n\nThese variations all convey the same essential instructions, but with slightly different tones and levels of formality.
