The sheer length and detail of the instructions, coupled with the sophisticated mathematical concepts involved in the examples, could lead to the model getting lost in the process or failing to appropriately prioritize the different aspects of the prompt.  The model might focus on certain aspects (like showing all steps) at the expense of accurately solving the problem itself.  A simpler, more focused prompt might yield better results."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt, while comprehensive, lacks specific guidance on how to approach problems that require combinatorial reasoning or sophisticated geometric arguments.  Examples 1 and 2, in particular, demand insightful counting strategies (Example 1) and a deep understanding of geometric properties and relationships (Example 2). The general problem-solving strategy outlined is insufficient to guide the model towards the correct solution path in these cases.  The prompt's focus on algebraic manipulation and calculus techniques might overshadow the need for more creative approaches to problem-solving. Example 3 also requires a strong understanding of number theory and combinatorial probability, which is not explicitly addressed in the prompt."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt, while comprehensive, lacks specific instructions or examples tailored to the diverse problem-solving techniques required by the examples.  It provides general guidance (e.g., \"For problems involving logarithms...\"), but the examples demand more specialized approaches (combinatorics, geometric reasoning, and a blend of geometry and algebra). The prompt's generality is insufficient to guide the model effectively through the nuanced steps needed for these complex problems.  The model might understand the general principles but fail to apply them correctly in the context of these specific mathematical areas."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt is overly broad and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to approach problems that require clever combinatorial arguments or insightful problem-solving strategies, as seen in the examples.  While it mentions techniques like inclusion-exclusion and generating functions, it doesn't offer concrete examples of how to apply these techniques in the context of specific problem types.

feedbacks: ["The prompt provides a highly detailed list of techniques for specific mathematical areas, but it doesn't offer guidance on how to approach problems that might require a combination of techniques or a more intuitive, less formulaic approach.  The examples provided seem to require a blend of combinatorics and perhaps some clever counting arguments rather than a direct application of a single, explicitly mentioned technique. The prompt's focus on specific methods might have led the model to miss the more insightful, less algorithmic solution pathways needed for these problems."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt provides a very general and extensive list of problem-solving strategies applicable to a wide range of mathematical areas. While this is beneficial in many cases, it might overwhelm the model for specific problems like the examples given.  The model might get lost in the plethora of suggested techniques and fail to identify the most efficient or relevant approach for a particular problem.  The examples require more specialized reasoning and combinatorial insight that the general guidance in the prompt doesn't explicitly address.  The prompt needs to be more focused and less encyclopedic to improve performance on specific problem types.  Instead of listing all possible methods, the prompt should guide the model towards the most likely successful approach for the given problem structure."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt provides a list of techniques for specific mathematical areas but doesn't offer a general strategy for problem decomposition or selecting the appropriate techniques when faced with a novel problem.  The examples provided require a more nuanced approach than simply applying the listed rules.  The prompt focuses on *applying* techniques rather than on *identifying* the relevant techniques in the first place.  The solver needs to infer the relevant mathematical areas (e.g., combinatorics and graph theory in Example 2) and then select appropriate methods. The prompt doesn't adequately address this crucial problem-solving step."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt, while comprehensive, lacks explicit instructions on how to handle the specific geometric complexities and combinatorial arguments required by the given examples.  It emphasizes general problem-solving strategies but doesn't provide guidance on how to translate those strategies into concrete steps for these particular problem types.

feedbacks: ["The prompt, while comprehensive, might be overwhelming for the model.  The sheer number of instructions and the requirement to explicitly analyze problem type, identify relevant techniques, and justify every step could lead to the model getting lost in the process or making errors due to the cognitive load.
