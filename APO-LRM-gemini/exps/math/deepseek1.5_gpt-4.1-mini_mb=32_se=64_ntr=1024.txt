The examples given require a systematic approach and potentially multiple steps of reasoning which the model may have failed to decompose effectively. The emphasis on a single, complete explanation might have overwhelmed the model, leading to incomplete or incorrect solutions, especially for problems requiring multiple steps or a combinatorial approach (like Example 1 and 2).  The model might have attempted a shortcut or a flawed overall strategy instead of a step-by-step approach."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt lacks specific instructions or guidance on how to approach different types of mathematical problems.  The problems presented require diverse problem-solving strategies (geometric reasoning, combinatorial arguments, calculus optimization). The general prompt, while encouraging clear explanation, doesn't provide scaffolding or hints on techniques applicable to the specific problem types. The model might lack the ability to choose the appropriate approach without more specific guidance.  For example, it may not automatically recognize that Example 1 requires using properties of ellipses and rectangles, or that Example 3 is an optimization problem requiring calculus techniques.  The model might attempt a generic approach that fails for these specialized problems."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt is overly prescriptive and focuses on procedural steps rather than encouraging genuine mathematical reasoning.  While outlining steps is helpful, the rigidity of the prompt might hinder the model's ability to apply appropriate strategies flexibly.  The examples require insight and problem-solving beyond simply following a checklist of procedures (e.g., recognizing patterns in Example 1, devising a systematic counting approach in Example 2, using polynomial interpolation in Example 3, and understanding expectation in Example 4). The model might get bogged down in the prescribed steps and fail to see the higher-level mathematical concepts needed for a solution.  For example, in Example 1, the model might get stuck trying to enumerate all possible paths rather than identifying a more efficient counting strategy."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt is overly prescriptive and doesn't account for the diversity of problem-solving strategies.  While it encourages step-by-step explanations and the use of specific formulas (like nPr, nCr), some problems, like Example 1 (counting the number of 4s and 8s in page numbers), are more efficiently solved using a different approach than directly applying combinatorial formulas.  The prompt's rigidity might hinder the model from finding and applying more efficient or intuitive solutions, leading to incorrect or incomplete answers.  The model might get stuck trying to force a fit to the prescribed methods instead of finding a more natural solution path."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt is overly prescriptive and doesn't account for the diverse range of problem-solving approaches.  While it encourages step-by-step solutions and explicit reasoning, it might be too rigid for problems that can be solved more efficiently using alternative methods or insights. The model might struggle to adapt to problems that don't neatly fit the prescribed structure (e.g., solving a quadratic equation in complex numbers might not benefit from a strictly step-by-step algebraic manipulation as much as a more insightful approach).  The model might get \"stuck\" trying to force a solution into the prescribed format rather than finding the most efficient solution."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt is overly prescriptive and doesn't account for the diversity of problem-solving strategies.  While it encourages step-by-step explanations and the use of specific formulas where applicable (like permutations/combinations), it doesn't allow for alternative, equally valid approaches. For instance, Example 1 could be solved using a simple counting argument without explicitly mentioning permutations, but the prompt's rigidity might penalize such a solution.  The other examples may require more sophisticated techniques or insights beyond the explicitly mentioned rules, leading to incorrect responses if the model rigidly adheres to the prompt's instructions instead of employing more creative mathematical reasoning."]

feedbacks: ["The prompt is too rigid and prescriptive, particularly regarding the explicit steps for probability problems.  While outlining the sample space, event of interest, and calculation is helpful for many probability problems, it's not universally applicable or the most efficient approach for all problems.  The examples show problems where a different, more intuitive or efficient method might be more suitable, and the rigid structure of the prompt may prevent the model from using those methods.  For instance, in the multiple-of-3 problem, a direct calculation of the complementary probability might be simpler than meticulously listing the sample space.  Similarly, the perfect power problem might benefit from a more combinatorial approach than explicitly laying out the sample space of 150 numbers. The model might be penalized for not following the prescribed format even if it correctly understands and solves the problem using a different, valid method."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt's focus on probability-specific steps (sample space, event of interest, calculation) is too narrow and doesn't apply to all mathematical reasoning problems.

The rigid structure hinders the response's ability to adapt to different problem types."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt lacks specific guidance on handling advanced mathematical concepts like polynomial factorization (Example 1) and sophisticated counting techniques that go beyond basic combinations and permutations (Examples 3 and 4).

feedbacks: ["The prompt lacks explicit instructions on how to handle probability problems. While it mentions defining methods for counting, it doesn't provide a framework for calculating probabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple events (like tossing two dice or choosing seats).

The prompt needs to be more specific about how to approach probability problems, perhaps by suggesting the use of counting techniques (combinations, permutations) to find the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt lacks explicit instructions on how to handle probabilistic reasoning.

feedbacks: ["The prompt, while comprehensive in its instructions, doesn't explicitly address the crucial step of *formally defining the sample space and the event of interest* before attempting to calculate the probability.
